/*
  Define a class called Logger that takes the name of 
  a file in its constructor and provides a method 
  for writing messages to that file. 
  Donâ€™t worry about the actual file I/O operations. 
  Just define the class with the right members. 
*/

  constructor(public logFile: string) {}

  log(message: string): string {

/*
  What is the difference between private and protected members?
*/

/*

  the declared class, and a protected member is a member only
  accesible within the declared class but can also be accesible
  from child classes who extend the based declared class
